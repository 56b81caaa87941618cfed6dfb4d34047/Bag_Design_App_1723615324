In response, the AI inquired whether the user wanted all buttons changed to a specific color or only selective ones and whether the change should apply to the background, text, or both. Following this, the user specified their desire for the buttons to be red instead, which prompted a similar set of questions from the AI regarding shade preferences and whether the text color should change for visibility.\n\nSubsequently, the AI confirmed it was making the buttons green as requested, but the user reiterated their need for the buttons to be green. Additional features were proposed by the AI throughout the conversation, including color customization options, theme switching, real-time UI editing, and accessibility settings. The user indicated interest in several features, such as implementing hover effects, button loading states, and tooltips for improved user interaction, while also confirming the need for accessibility features for visually impaired users. The AI concluded by asking the user to provide more details about the project to better assist with their requests.",
