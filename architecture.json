Additionally, the AI provided a list of potential features for the buttons, including hover effects, accessibility options, loading states, varied shapes for actions, tooltips, and animation effects, with some features checked as implemented and others not. The user repeated their request for green buttons, prompting the AI to confirm it was addressing this.
